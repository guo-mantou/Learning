# Learning

For personal reason, I want to create this repository to record some code and doc, which  
have learned or current learning. 

There are always things should be learn for a programmer, so it won't be a small repository, I guess. 

## Subjects

There may have two subjects descripted as following:
- Language
- Technology

And the hierarchy is:
